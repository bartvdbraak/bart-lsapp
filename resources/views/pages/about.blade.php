You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? Did I mention we have comfy chairs? You've swallowed a planet! I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. You hit me with a cricket bat.

                <p>All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.</p>

I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself. Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.</p>
